# Mission-To-Mars
In this project, information regarding the planet Mars was scraped from several different websites using a variety of tools.  The information can then be displayed in a browser app using Flask.  Initially, python scripts were written using the BeautifulSoup and Splinter tools to automate the visiting and extracting of data like news and images of Mars.  Mongo was then used to store the data, before an HTML index file was created as a template to ultimately run the Flask app.
